DESCRIPTION
==

Convert integers to short, human-scannable alphanumeric strings (skipping 'l', '1', 'o', '0', etc.) and back.

Unlike the code behind url shorteners, this supports case-insensitive conversion and
omits letters and numbers that are difficult to distinguish by sight (like 'l' and '1')

SYNOPSIS
== 

    # 45.human_code
    # => '3G'
    # 5234233.human_code
    # '7PQP9'
    # 'AYH783XM3AJZ99'.human_code
    # => 218567976681298046129
    # 218567976681298046129.human_code
    # => 'AYH783XM3AJZ99'
    #
    ## strings that weren't generated by this library don't get converted
    #
    # "ajYz2".human_code
    # => "ajyz2"
    #
    ## But your users shouldn't have to use the shift key
    #
    # 'AJYZ2'.human_code
    # => 7893623
    # "ajYz2".human_code :fix_case => true
    # => 7893623


INSTALL
==
