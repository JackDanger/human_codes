= Human Codes

* http://github.com/JackDanger/human_codes

== DESCRIPTION:

Convert integers to short, human-scannable alphanumeric strings (A-Za-z0-9) and back.

Unlike the code behind url shorteners, this supports case-insensitive conversion and
omits letters and numbers that are difficult to distinguish by sight (like 'l' and '1')

== SYNOPSIS:

  # 45.human_code
  # => '2E'
  # 5234233.human_code
  # '5ZRJT'
  # 'AYH783XM3AJZ99'.human_code
  # => 367212504123260337416
  # 367212504123260337416.human_code
  # => 'AYH783XM3AJZ99'
  #
  ## strings that weren't generated by this library don't get converted
  #
  # "ajYz2".human_code
  # => "ajyz2"
  #
  ## But your users shouldn't have to use the shift key
  #
  # "AJYZ2".human_code
  # => 10025953
  # "ajYz2".human_code :fix_case => true
  # => 10025953


== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install human_codes
